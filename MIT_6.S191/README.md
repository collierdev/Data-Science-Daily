# MIT 6.S191 Lab 1: Intro to TensorFlow and Music Generation with RNNs

## Part 1: Intro to TensorFlow
I will be using this to practice tensorflow use, learning new ways to call the Keras API, and learnging Tensorflow's new imperative execution style.

## Part 2: Music Generation with RNNs
In this section a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) for music generation will be created. We will be using a "character RNN" to predict the next chracter of sheet music in ABC notation. Finally, we will sample from this model to generate a new music file.
